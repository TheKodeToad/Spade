Initial version of server API I never released, with some removed files. This comes with a full API and implementation.

Why am I releasing this? It may be useful for future developers, as it shows how to use mixins without a mod loader, and also how to load plugin JARs.

For whatever reason, I added Groovy plugin support, allowing plugins to be created without Java. Shortly afterwards, I created a second version.
