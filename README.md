Initial version of server API I never released, with some removed files. This comes with a full API and implementation. Once I was fed up, I created a second version, focusing more on the API than the implementation.

Why am I releasing this? It may be useful for future developers, as it shows how to use mixins without a mod loader, and also how to load plugin JARs.
